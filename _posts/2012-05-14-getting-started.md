Failure is essential to success. Just as the only way to logically prove a fact, there must be a possible negation, so are failing/succeding two sides of the same coin. One can not exist with out the possibilty of the other.

Sounds trite, or as Dan Dennett puts it; "you've just made a deepity", but the realisation that unless there is the chance of failure, you can't have success means that failure is suddenly far less worrisome. Even if you set out to fail you may accidentaly hit the bullseye, and if that's the case, we should just get out there and be a little crazy in what we think we can achieve.

Moral of the story, don't let the chance of failure stop you from getting started, it actually means you may just succeed instead.
