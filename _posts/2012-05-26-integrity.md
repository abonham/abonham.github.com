In conversation with a good friend some time ago, he mentioned that John Gruber of Daring Fireball was a great example of journalistic integrity. As above, John is a man unafraid to straight up say "guilty as charged". If there was more of this in the world, we could stop worrying so much about always being right and get on with doing something else far more interesting.
