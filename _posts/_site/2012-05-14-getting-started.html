<p>Failure is essential to success. Just as the only way to logically prove a fact, there must be a possible negation, so are failing/succeding two sides of the same coin. One can not exist with out the possibilty of the other.</p>

<p>Sounds trite, or as Dan Dennett puts it; &#8220;you&#8217;ve just made a deepity&#8221;, but the realisation that unless there is the chance of failure, you can&#8217;t have success means that failure is suddenly far less worrisome. Even if you set out to fail you may accidentaly hit the bullseye, and if that&#8217;s the case, we should just get out there and be a little crazy in what we think we can achieve.</p>

<p>Moral of the story, don&#8217;t let the chance of failure stop you from getting started, it actually means you may just succeed instead.</p>
