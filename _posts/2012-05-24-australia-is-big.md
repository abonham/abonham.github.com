Being on the bottom of the world (who gets to define which direction is down on a cosmic scale anyway?), so far away from everthing else, the Australian sense of distance can be somewhat distorted. It happens when the closest continent is 14 hours away by 747. 

When put in [perspective](http://mapfrappe.blogspot.ca/2011/02/australia.html) you realise just how little of that space our population of 22 million actually use. 

One image displays Tokyo overlaid by Sydney. For comparison, the city of Tokyo is home to 32 million people. That's 10 million more than all of Australia. In less space than our largest city.
