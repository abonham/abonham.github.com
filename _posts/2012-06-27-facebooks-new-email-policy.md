As you all no doubt saw a few days ago, Facebook changed the default email address for all profiles to the company branded  accountname@facebook.com, this caused a relatively minor stir. I now think the timing is absolutely no coincidence when seen in conjunction with iOS 6 being just around the corner. 

I've just installed the iOS 6 Beta on my dev phone, synced contacts with iCloud then Facebook and viola, @facebook.com address are now the default for 60% of my contacts.

It's certainly one way to get traction for a new email platform.
